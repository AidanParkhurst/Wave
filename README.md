# Wave
This is a small game I put together while experimenting with the super pleasant p5.js library.

A pretty diamond spins up and down a rail, which you can move by pressing the left or right arrow keys. Your goal is to protect the diamond from the evil red dots that fly in from the sides of the screen.

If you'd like to play it, it's hosted [HERE](https://aidanparkhurst.github.io/Wave/) on Github pages :).
